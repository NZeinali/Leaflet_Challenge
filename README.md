# Leaflet Project - Visualising Data with Leaflet

## Task

### Level 1: Basic Visualisation

![2-BasicMap](Images/2-BasicMap.png)

The first task is to visualise an earthquake data set.

1. **Get the data set**

   ![3-Data](Images/3-Data.png)

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. A dataset is picked from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page to visualise data using a JSON representation of that data.

2. **Import & Visualise the Data**

   A map is created using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in colour.

   * Popups are included that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

### Level 2: More Data

A second data set on the map is plotted to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates is found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.
